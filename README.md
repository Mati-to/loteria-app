# Bingo/lota-app
It started as an app to randomize numbers between 1 and 99, and now it finished as a "bingo" app. My inspiration for this was my family, when I'm with my parents and 
granparents we often play something we called in my country "Lota", and this app would help to make the game more easier for us, and above all, for the person who calls 
 the numbers.

The app take a randomized number between 1 and 99, and then display this number on screen. As more numbers are taken out, a record is kept of what these have been for 
later consultation on screen.

I did this using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript.
